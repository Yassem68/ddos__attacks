# Attacks Project !

In this project we'll work as a group of 2. The group will be Yassem Mohareb and Fayçal Bloul.

## This is a Python project where we are testing DOS attacks.

Create a Python project in which you simulate and detect DOS attacks. The detected attacks must be
logged into a local csv database.
Using the database, answer the following questions on a Juptyer Notebook and illustrate your answer
using a plot.
Where are locate the suspect IP addresses?
What are the most common attack?
## DOS Attack simulation and detection

To simulate some DOS attacks, you can get help from the attached script. You can use two computers:
one to launch and the other. You can simulate IP addresses using a random method.
To detect the attacks, you can use the SniffnDetect module. The module can be found here:
https://github.com/priyamharsh14/SniffnDetect
## Data manipulation and visualization

To answer the questions, you’ll have to log the detected attacks on a local csv database. You can
answer the questions using a jupyter notebook in which you’ll provide a snippet of the code, a text
answer and a plot to illustrate your answer.
To get the location of the suspect IP addresses, you can use a web request to ip-api.com to get the
country. The data can then be plotted on an map.
## Deliverable

You’ll provide a copy of your python project. The project should be well commented and organized.

The project should contains all the scripts and the notebook.
