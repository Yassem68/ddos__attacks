# How to use me !

It's really simple you have a victim, and a attacker !
You have to run all the code as an administrator to avoid issue.


## The attacker !

To run the code you don't need to be in an virtual environnment. You just have to run the code attacks.py and put the target ip (victim's Ip), how do you want to attack the victim (PoD, smurf,etc..) and how many times do you want to attack the victim.


## The victim

To run the code you have to run two terminals, one in the virtual environment ".\venv\Scripts\activate" and go to the "SniffnDetect" repertory and start the "app.py" (python3 .\attacks.Py ). Then it should start a local server where you can see the packets and the attacks that you'll launch !
