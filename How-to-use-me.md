# How to use me !

It's really simple you have a victim, and a attacker !


## The attacker !

To run the code you have to run two terminals, one in the virtual environment ".\venv\Scripts\activate" and go to the "SniffnDetect" repertory and start the "app.py" (python3 .\attacks.Py ). Then it should start a local server where you can see the packets and the attacks that you'll launch !
